Problem Statement :-

In the 21st century, a person’s life is no longer only physical. It is spread across multiple digital platforms such as:

-Banking apps

-Crypto wallets

-Cloud storage (photos, documents)

-Social media accounts

-Encrypted password managers

However, current inheritance and nominee systems only work for individual services.
They do not provide a complete view of a person’s digital life.

As a result:

Families don’t know what digital assets exist

Passwords and encrypted data become inaccessible

Valuable money and memories are permanently lost

This creates a situation called “Digital Paralysis”, where families cannot access or manage digital assets after the owner’s death or incapacity.
