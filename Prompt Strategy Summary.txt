 - Encrypt the given text using XOR encryption.
   Use the provided secret key.
   Apply XOR operation character-by-character between the text and the key.
   If the key is shorter than the text, repeat the key cyclically.
   Output the encrypted result in hexadecimal format.
 
 - Decrypt the given XOR-encrypted hexadecimal text.
   Use the same secret key that was used during encryption.
   Apply XOR operation to retrieve the original plaintext.
   Ensure the output is human-readable text.
