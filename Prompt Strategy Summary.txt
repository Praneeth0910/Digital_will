Randhir:-
 - Encrypt the given data using XOR encryption.
   Use the provided secret key.
   Apply XOR operation character-by-character between the text and the key.
   If the key is shorter than the text, repeat the key cyclically.
   Output the encrypted result in hexadecimal format.
 
 - Decrypt the given XOR-encrypted hexadecimal text.
   Use the same secret key that was used during encryption.
   Apply XOR operation to retrieve the original plaintext.
   Ensure the output is human-readable text.

Aditya:-
- Led the design of a native C++ security engine responsible for encrypting and decrypting sensitive digital asset metadata.
-Defined strict separation of concerns between frontend, backend, cryptographic logic, and blockchain layers.
-Implemented secure Python ↔ C++ bindings to ensure the backend never handles plaintext secrets.
-Contributed to backend architecture using Python (FastAPI), focusing on inactivity-based access logic and secure API design.
-Collaborated on the trust layer design using Solidity smart contracts to enable verifiable, tamper-resistant continuity triggers.
-Helped establish judge-safe terminology and framing, avoiding morbid or sensitive language while preserving technical clarity.
-Supported API contract definition to enable parallel frontend–backend development and smooth final integration.
