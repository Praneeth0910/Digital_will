Randhir:-
 - Encrypt the given data using XOR encryption.
   Use the provided secret key.
   Apply XOR operation character-by-character between the text and the key.
   If the key is shorter than the text, repeat the key cyclically.
   Output the encrypted result in hexadecimal format.
 
 - Decrypt the given XOR-encrypted hexadecimal text.
   Use the same secret key that was used during encryption.
   Apply XOR operation to retrieve the original plaintext.
   Ensure the output is human-readable text.

Aditya:-
- Led the design of a native C++ security engine responsible for encrypting and decrypting sensitive digital asset metadata.
-Defined strict separation of concerns between frontend, backend, cryptographic logic, and blockchain layers.
-Implemented secure Python ↔ C++ bindings to ensure the backend never handles plaintext secrets.
-Contributed to backend architecture using Python (FastAPI), focusing on inactivity-based access logic and secure API design.
-Collaborated on the trust layer design using Solidity smart contracts to enable verifiable, tamper-resistant continuity triggers.
-Helped establish judge-safe terminology and framing, avoiding morbid or sensitive language while preserving technical clarity.
-Supported API contract definition to enable parallel frontend–backend development and smooth final integration.

Praneeth:-
-Developed the Core Integration Logic (glue_algorithm.py):You wrote the central Python orchestrator that manages the entire lifecycle of a file (Split -> Encrypt -> Hide -> Retrieve).
-Cross-Language Interoperability: You successfully implemented ctypes to load the C encryption library (mechanic.dll) and subprocess to control the C++ splitting engines (split.exe/merge.exe), enabling seamless    communication between three different languages.
-Designed the "Fractal Storage" Workflow:
    Secure Storage: Implemented the secure_store function, which automates the fragmentation of sensitive files, encrypts them individually, and scatters them with obfuscated system filenames(e.g.,sys_A1aHmAPh.dat).
-Automated Retrieval: Built the secure_retrieve logic that reverses the entropy, decrypting shards and stitching them back together using the C++ merger.
-Solved Critical Architecture Challenges:Path Independence: You fixed the "File Not Found" system errors by implementing dynamic absolute pathing (BASE_DIR), ensuring the backend runs reliably from any directory  or environment.
-Logic Bridging: You identified and fixed a critical logic gap in the C++ Merger by writing a Python adapter that strips file suffixes (_shard_) before passing arguments, preventing the merge engine from crashing.
-System State Management:Implemented the Master Map system (master_map.json) to track the relationship between original files and their hidden, encrypted shards without exposing their contents.
-Security Feature Design (Dead Man's Switch):You conceptualized and integrated the "Inactivity Trigger" logic, designing the system to automatically execute the retrieval protocol and alert the nominee after a defined grace period (e.g., 14 days of silence).
