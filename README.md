### Solving the Crisis of Digital Inheritance
“We never store secrets. We only orchestrate access.”

## 🚨 Problem

In the 21st century, an individual’s life is no longer just physical.  
It is spread across banking apps, crypto wallets, cloud storage, social media, and encrypted password managers.

When a person passes away or becomes incapacitated, families face **Digital Paralysis**.

Traditional nominee systems are fragmented:
- A nominee for one bank has no access to other accounts
- Crypto wallets become permanently locked
- Cloud memories are deleted due to inactivity
- Encrypted data is unrecoverable without master credentials

Billions in digital assets and irreplaceable memories are lost every year.

---

## 🌍 Why This Matters

This is not just a technical failure — it is an emotional and financial crisis.

Families are unable to:
- Retrieve memories
- Close digital accounts
- Access important documents
- Execute the final wishes of their loved ones

Our digital lives have evolved, but inheritance systems have not.

## 💡 Our Solution

We are building **[App Name]**, a decentralized Digital Inheritance Platform with a **Dead Man’s Switch** and **Video-Based Security Authentication**.

The platform creates a secure **“Map of Life”** that:
- Indexes all critical digital assets
- Encrypts and stores access credentials
- Uses a video-based authentication mechanism as a secure identity proof
- Transfers access to beneficiaries when inactivity is confirmed

This bridges the gap between legal nomination and digital reality.

## 🎥 Video-Based Password System (Key Innovation)

Instead of relying only on traditional text passwords, our platform introduces **video-based authentication**.

### How it works:
- The user records a short **secure video** during setup
- The video acts as a **biometric identity proof**
- Encrypted metadata and verification patterns are stored (not raw video)
- During recovery or inheritance execution, the video is used as an additional security layer

### Why video passwords?
- Harder to steal or brute-force
- Adds human verification beyond text credentials
- Prevents unauthorized access and impersonation
- Acts as a Proof-of-Life and identity confirmation

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User registers digital assets (banks, crypto, cloud, documents)
2. Credentials and keys are encrypted
3. User records a secure authentication video
4. Trusted beneficiaries are assigned
5. Dead Man’s Switch monitors activity
6. Upon verified inactivity, access is released securely to beneficiaries

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- End-to-end encryption of all sensitive data
- Video data is never stored in raw form
- Zero-knowledge architecture
- Decentralized storage to prevent single point of failure
- Multi-layer authentication (encryption + video verification)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Python / C++
- Encryption: C-based XOR encryption module (prototype)
- Video Processing: Secure metadata extraction
- API Layer: Python ↔ C integration
- Storage: Decentralized / Local demo storage

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- AI-based liveness and deepfake detection
- Legal integration with wills and nominee systems
- Multi-party verification (lawyer + nominee)
- Government and banking API integration
- Advanced biometric authentication
