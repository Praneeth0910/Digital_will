# Digital Dark Age
### Solving the Crisis of Digital Inheritance


## 🚨 Problem

In the 21st century, an individual’s life is no longer just physical.  
It is distributed across dozens of digital platforms — banking apps, crypto wallets, cloud storage, social media, and encrypted password managers.

However, when a person passes away or becomes incapacitated, families face a **Digital Paralysis**.

Current inheritance systems are fragmented:
- A nominee for Bank A has no visibility into Bank B
- Crypto wallets become permanently inaccessible
- Cloud photos and personal memories are deleted due to inactivity
- Encrypted data is lost forever

Every year, billions of dollars in digital assets and decades of family history are lost simply because there is no unified digital inheritance system.


## 🌍 Why This Matters

This is not just a technical problem — it is a human one.

Families are left struggling to:
- Close digital accounts
- Retrieve sentimental memories
- Access critical documents
- Fulfill the final wishes of their loved ones

As our digital footprint grows, the gap between legal inheritance and digital reality continues to widen.


## 💡 Our Solution

We are building **[web id]**, a decentralized Digital Inheritance Platform and Dead Man’s Switch.

It creates a secure **“Map of Life”** that:
- Indexes all important digital assets
- Stores access credentials in encrypted form
- Automatically and securely transfers access to trusted beneficiaries when the user becomes inactive

Our solution bridges the gap between traditional legal nomination systems and modern digital lives.


## 🧠 How It Works

1. Users register their digital assets (banking, crypto, cloud, documents)
2. Sensitive information is encrypted before storage
3. Users assign trusted beneficiaries
4. A Dead Man’s Switch monitors user activity
5. Upon confirmed inactivity, access is securely released to beneficiaries


## 🔐 Security & Privacy

Security is at the core of our design:
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Zero-knowledge approach — the platform never sees raw credentials
- Decentralized storage to eliminate single points of failure
- User-controlled access, revocation, and recovery mechanisms


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: React
- Backend: Python / Node.js
- Encryption: C-based XOR encryption module (prototype)
- API Layer: Python ↔ C integration
- Storage: Decentralized / Local demo storage


## 🚀 Future Scope

- Legal integration with wills and nominee systems
- Multi-factor inactivity verification
- Government, banking, and cloud service API integration
- AI-based fraud detection and misuse prevention
- Support for enterprise and institutional users
