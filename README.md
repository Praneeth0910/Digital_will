### Solving the Crisis of Digital Inheritance
“We never store secrets. We only orchestrate access.”

## 🚨 Problem

In the 21st century, an individual’s life is no longer just physical.  
It is spread across banking apps, crypto wallets, cloud storage, social media, and encrypted password managers.

When a person passes away or becomes incapacitated, families face **Digital Paralysis**.

Traditional nominee systems are fragmented:
- A nominee for one bank has no access to other accounts
- Crypto wallets become permanently locked
- Cloud memories are deleted due to inactivity
- Encrypted data is unrecoverable without master credentials

Billions in digital assets and irreplaceable memories are lost every year.

---

## 🌍 Why This Matters

This is not just a technical failure — it is an emotional and financial crisis.

Families are unable to:
- Retrieve memories
- Close digital accounts
- Access important documents
- Execute the final wishes of their loved ones

Our digital lives have evolved, but inheritance systems have not.

## 💡 Our Solution

We are building Digital Will Web , a decentralized Digital Inheritance Platform with a **deceased/incapacitated person**.

The platform creates a secure **“Map of Life”** that:
- Indexes all critical digital assets
- Encrypts and stores access credentials
- Uses a digital death certificate/medical certificate - authentication mechanism as a secure identity proof
- Transfers access to beneficiaries when inactivity is confirmed

This bridges the gap between legal nomination and digital reality.

## 🎥 Death or medical certificate authentication(Key Innovation)

During the nominee's verification, we are performing authentication process of death/medical certificate with the deepseek model and crosschecking in the government database.

### How it works:
- The nominee is demanded to submit the required certificate
- This certificate is deep verified with the govn.databases and deepseek models
- Once verified technically the access is granted
- Then the secret vault info is shared to the nominees through end to end encrypted path

### Why this step is essential?
- Prevents fake breaching of the nominees
- Verification the inactivity of the user
- Build a end to end encrypted path flow 

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User registers digital assets (banks, crypto, cloud, documents)
2. Credentials and keys are encrypted
3. User saves digital asserts in this secret vault
4. Trusted beneficiaries are assigned
5. Deceased/Incapacitated Switch monitors activity
6. Upon verified inactivity, access is released securely to beneficiaries

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- End-to-end encryption of all sensitive data
- Secure vault data is never stored in raw form
- Zero-knowledge architecture
- Decentralized storage to prevent single point of failure
- Multi-layer authentication (encryption + death/medical certificate verification)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js/Typescript
- Backend: Python / C++ / C
- Encryption: C-based XOR encryption module (prototype)
- API Layer: Python ↔ C/C++ integration
- Storage: Decentralized / Local demo storage(For secure vault info) + MongoDB/NoSQL Database(For profile data)

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Video-Based Password System
- AI-based liveness and deepfake detection
- Legal integration with wills and nominee systems
- Multi-party verification (lawyer + nominee)
- Government and banking API integration
- Advanced biometric authentication
  
## 🎥 Video-Based Password System (Future Innovation Roadmap)

Instead of relying only on traditional text passwords, our platform is going to introduce **video-based authentication**.

### How it works:
- The user records a short **secure video** during setup
- The video acts as a **biometric identity proof**
- Encrypted metadata and verification patterns are stored (not raw video)
- During recovery or inheritance execution, the video is used as an additional security layer

### Why video passwords?
- Harder to steal or brute-force
- Adds human verification beyond text credentials
- Prevents unauthorized access and impersonation
- Acts as a Proof-of-Life and identity confirmation
